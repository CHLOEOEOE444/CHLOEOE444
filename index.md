# Poverty and Health
## By Chloe

### Welcome to my Agency Project
I made this project to spread poverty awareness

This website explores how poverty affects people's health around the world.

### What is Poverty?
Poverty means living with less than \$2.15 per day. This affects many aspects of life, especially health.

### How Does Poverty Affect Health?
1. Food Problems
   - Not enough healthy food
   - Poor nutrition
   - Limited access to clean water

2. Healthcare Problems
   - Can't afford doctor visits
   - Limited access to medicines
   - Delayed medical care
